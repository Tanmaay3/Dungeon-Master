## Dungeon-Master

My friend and I built this game using Java in our 3rd semester of college.

The aim of this project was to illustrate object oriented programming concepts. 

#### Game Description

A player moves through a cave using the keyboard, eliminates adversaries and collects the treasure. The game is played on the terminal and the floor design reprints after a command on the terminal.

A detailed description of the game can be viewed in the Problem_Description document.
